## Question
What is the best time of year to visit Bali, Indonesia?

## Short Answer
The best time to visit Bali is during the dry season from April to October, with May, June, and September offering ideal weather with fewer crowds.

## Detailed Answer
Bali has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: the dry season (April to October) and the wet season (November to March).

The dry season is generally considered the best time to visit Bali. During these months, especially May, June, and September, you'll experience less humidity, lower rainfall, and sunny days perfect for beach activities, hiking, and exploring temples. Temperatures typically range from 73째F to 91째F (23째C to 33째C).

July and August are the peak tourist months due to summer holidays in many countries. While the weather is excellent during this time, prices are higher, and popular attractions can be crowded.

The wet season (November to March) brings higher humidity and daily rainfall, typically in the form of afternoon thunderstorms. However, these months offer lush landscapes, fewer tourists, and lower prices. January and February are the rainiest months and may not be ideal if you're planning primarily outdoor activities.

### Additional Information
**Festivals to Consider:**
- Nyepi (Balinese New Year): Changes annually based on the lunar calendar
- Galungan and Kuningan: Occur every 210 days according to the Balinese calendar
- Bali Arts Festival: Usually held in June and July

**Regional Variations:**
The weather can vary across different parts of Bali. Central mountainous areas like Ubud tend to be cooler and receive more rainfall than coastal areas like Kuta or Seminyak.
